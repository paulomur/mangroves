Murillo-Sandoval April 13, 2021 1 Overview Mangroves play a critical role in our social, economic, and ecological resources, but there are gaps in our understanding of carbon accounting and management. This is why we use field and remote observations to monitor its status. Figure 1.1: Mangroves Source: Pixabay This tutorial uses different satellite data to map the current extent of mangroves using Sentinel 1 &amp; 2 and historically using Landsat legacy.

However, our analysis can be applied everywhere. The steps to map mangroves and other common land cover classes are: Pre-processing/Exporting Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Organizing a basemap (get training data) Applying an object-based classifier All previous steps can be easily modified for specific conditions. First thing is adding the repository: In that the repository you can find the main library plus the examples to run the analysis. 2.1 Step1: Preprocessing Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Preprocessing data from S1 requires the effective removal of speckle noise We use Perona-Malik filter to remove speckle for each image. For Sentinel-2 we remove clouds and shadows. All functions allows to obtain better spectral information for the period 2019-2020. After improving the data, a image composite using the median across all available images is created and saved it as an asset. 2.2 Step2: Organizing a basemap (get training data) Getting training data is a exhausting process. Mostly manual regularly. Here we use previous map created by Colombia Government from which we select specific land cover classes. The basemap follows the Corine Land Cover methodology used officially in Colombia. For this exercise, five classes were used: 1. Mangroves 2. Water 3. Dense Forest &gt;80% tree canopy cover 4. Non-forest &lt;20% tree canopy cover 5. Other vegetation (shurb, herbaceous, wet forest) 2.3 Step3: Applying an object-based classifier Object-based classifiers are more robust than convetional pixel-based analysis. We used the SNIC algorithm to detect clusters using the Mangroves Vegetation Indices (MVI). See article here "],["mapping-mangroves-using-landsat-archive.html", "3 Mapping mangroves using Landsat archive", " 3 Mapping mangroves using Landsat archive For mapping historical mangroves change using Landsat our approach is a bit different than for S1+S2. The Colombian Pacific is the most rainy region worldwide, consequently obtain cloud-free optical data is very difficult for this region. To improve spectral data and filling gaps for missing year I employ LandTrendr. Given the lack of images we create 3-year composites from 1985-2020 that were linearly improved using temporal segmentation from Landtrendr. Figure 3.1: LandTrendr segmentation example "]]
