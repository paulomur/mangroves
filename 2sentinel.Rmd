# Mapping mangroves using Sentinel1&2

We use Colombia as study region for this analysis. However, our analysis can be applied everywhere. The steps to map mangroves and other common land cover classes are:


1. Pre-processing/Exporting Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2
2. Organizing a basemap (get training data)
3. Applying an object-based classifier


All previous steps can be easily modified for specific conditions.

First thing is adding the repository:

In that the repository you can find the main library plus the examples to run the analysis.


## Step1: Preprocessing Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2

Preprocessing data from S1 requires the effective removal of speckle noise
We use Perona-Malik filter to remove speckle for each image. For Sentinel-2 we remove clouds and shadows. All functions allows to obtain better spectral information for the period 2019-2020.

After improving the data, a image composite using the "median" across
all available images is created and saved it as an asset.

## Step2:  Organizing a basemap (get training data)

Getting training data is a exhausting process. Mostly manual regularly.
Here we use previous map created by Colombia Government from which we select specific land cover classes. The basemap follows the Corine Land Cover methodology used officially in Colombia.

For this exercise, five classes were used:
1. Mangroves
2. Water
3. Dense Forest >80% tree canopy cover
4. Non-forest   <20% tree canopy cover
5. Other vegetation (shurb, herbaceous, wet forest)


## Step3: Applying an object-based classifier

Object-based classifiers are more robust than convetional pixel-based analysis. We used the SNIC algorithm to detect clusters using the Mangroves Vegetation Indices (MVI).
